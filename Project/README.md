# Connect 4 - ALDA individual project

In the course we had a section where we would create a small programming project of our choice. 
I chose to create a game of Connect 4 where you can play both multiplayer as well as single player against an AI.

The real task of the project was to create an AI that uses the MinMax algorithm to find the best moves to play. 
This implementation uses Alpha Beta pruning in the algorithm to be able to search deeper and thus play stronger moves.
There are different difficulty settings for the AI and the program is built in such a way that you could match 2 AI's 
against each other, but that functionality is not yet implemented in the user interface of the program.
